                    <p>-Anyone can become an instructor on Studionear as long as they genuinely possess the skill they are trying to teach. The education and experience of instructors is listed on their Studionear profile page along with the ratings they’ve received from their past students. This should allow you to pick and decide whether or not you would like to take classes from the instructor. You can also request a free short demo session from an instructor and then decide whether you want to take paid lessons from them. 
                        We have no way to verify the authenticity of the education and experience an instructor publishes on their Studionear profile. We do however conduct a quick video session with the instructor before they are allowed to offer a course on our website.</p>

                    <p>-	Studionear has an inbuilt video conferencing platform where the instructors and the students will teach and learn through a webcam and microphone. There is no need to leave your house or even your room to give or take lessons. We do however request that you keep your background presentable while the live video session is going on. Once a student has signed up for a course, a course countdown will appear on your dashboard and when it is time, the “Start” button next to the counter will turn green and you will be able to join the session simply by clicking on the green “Start” button. </p>
